# Six's Tweaks
When playing the game with mods just isn't good enough for your particular tastes, but writing your own whole mod from scratch is too much work, you mod the mods to suit your needs.

Instead of forking my own builds, I'm putting patches in here for my own functionality.

## Currently includes:
* A change to Coal Liquifaction to produce only Heavy Oil

## Currently in forked builds, to reimplement as a patch here:
* Deep Core mining processing changes
* Personal Laser damage category, laser turret drain rate / buffer size

## Future ideas:
* Bob's Modules combined sets recipes to require lvl+1 input modules, and other expensive goodies. Raw Productivity is OP, gotta make it work for it.
* Rework Beacon power usage as xxKw * area covered * module slots
* Redo Geothermal power to use vanilla heat exchanger, have hotspots output at varying temps.

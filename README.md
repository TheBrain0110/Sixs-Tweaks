# Six's Tweaks
When playing the game with mods just isn't good enough for your particular tastes, but writing your own whole mod from scratch is too much work, you mod the mods to suit your needs.

Instead of forking my own builds, I'm putting patches in here for my own functionality.

Mostly for personal use, but uploaded to the Mod Portal to be multiplayer-sync-compatible.

Originally written for some mostly-obsolete tweaks to VTK Deep Core mining, laser turrets and Bob's Modules in the 0.16/0.17 days. Most of that stripped out for 1.0 and focusing mostly on Krastorio2.
See the Legacy branch on GitHub for other old stuff.

## Currently includes:
* Made the Krastorio2 landfill-from-sand recipe more efficient for the work of processing stone into sand, and adds wood as an ingredient

* More to come as I feel the need, now that I've set up the base...
